Please use the reference above if you use this material in your research.

## Running the code 
1. Run `python Atomix.py -i {instance} -t {timeLimit} -m {memoryLimit}`. 
1. The python script recompiles the code under `src` for every run. Always use it to run the algorithm.
1. To output the optimal solution path, add `--path`. For more options, see `--help`.

To run [HÃ¼ffner et al. (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45422-5_17)'s Atomix code, use the script and instances in `src/hueffner`.
